# The NTIA Extended Hata (eHata) Urban Propagation Model for Matlab #

The original [NTIA eHata model](https://github.com/NTIA/ehata) was implement in C++, which does not work with Matlab. This repository slightly modified the source code so that the model would appear to be written in C and thus loadable in Maltab.

## Notes

- Tested with Matlab 2021a for both Windows and Ubuntu.
- On Windows, please use the library files `ehata.dll` (built in Visual Studio 2019) and `ehata.h` under `LibReleasesForMatlab`.
- On Ubuntu, please use `ehata.so` (built based on the included CMake file `CMakeLists.txt`) and `ehata.h` in the same directory.
- Note that the header file `ehata.h` we feed into Matlab is different from that in the source code (under directory `include`).
- More information about the original NTIA eHata library can be found below.

# The Extended Hata (eHata) Urban Propagation Model #

This code repository contains a C++ reference version of the eHata
urban propagation model.  The model was developed by NTIA and used in NTIA
Technical Report [TR-15-517](https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/publications/2805.aspx),
"3.5 GHz Exclusion Zone Analyses and Methodology".

## Inputs ##

| Variable      | Type     | Units | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `pfl`         | double[] |       | A terrain profile line, from the mobile to the base station.  EHata uses the ITM-method of formatting terrain information, in that: <ul><li>`pfl[0]` : Number of elevation points - 1</li><li>`pfl[1]` : Resolution, in meters</li><li>`pfl[i]` : Elevation above sea level, in meters</li></ul> |
| `f__mhz`      | double   | MHz   | Frequency   |
| `h_m__meter`  | double   | meter | The height of the mobile |
| `h_b__meter`  | double   | meter | The height of the base station |
| `enviro_code` | int      |       | The NLCD environment code |
| `reliability` | double   |       | The quantile percent not exceeded of the signal.  Limits: 0 < `reliability` < 1  |

## Outputs ##

| Variable      | Type   | Units | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `plb`         | double | dB    | Path loss   |
| `intervalues` | struct |       | [Optional] A data structure containing intermediate values from the eHata calculations |

## Intermediate Values ##

When calling the _ExtendedHata_DBG()_ function, the function will populate `intervalues` with intermediate values from the eHata
calculations.  Those values are as follows:

| Variable         | Type      | Units       | Description |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `d_bp__km`       | double    | km          | The breakpoint distance |
| `att_1km`        | double    | dB          | Attenuation at 1 km |
| `att_100km`      | double    | dB          | Attenuation at 100 km |
| `h_b_eff__meter` | double    | meter       | Effective height of the base station |
| `h_m_eff__meter` | double    | meter       | Effective height of the mobile |
| `pfl10__meter`   | double    | meter       | 10% terrain quantile |
| `pfl50__meter`   | double    | meter       | 50% terrain quantile |
| `pfl90__meter`   | double    | meter       | 90% terrain quantile |
| `deltah__meter`  | double    | meter       | Terrain irregularity parameter |
| `d__km`          | double    | km          | Path distance |
| `d_hzn__meter`   | double[2] | meter       | Horizon distances |
| `h_avg__meter`   | double[2] | meter       | Average heights |
| `theta_m__mrad`  | double    | milliradian | Slope of the terrain at the at the mobile |
| `beta`           | double    |             | Percentage of path that is sea |
| `iend_ov_sea`    | int       |             | Flag specifying which end is over the sea |
| `hedge_tilda`    | double    | meter       | Horizon correction factor |
| `single_horizon` | bool      |             | Flag for specifying number of horizons |
| `slope_max`      | double    | milliradian | Intermediate value when calculating the mobile terrain slope |
| `slope_min`      | double    | milliradian | Intermediate value when calculating the mobile terrain slope |

## Notes on Code Style ##

* In general, variables follow the naming convention in which a single underscore
denotes a subscript (pseudo-LaTeX format), where a double underscore is followed
by the units, i.e. `h_m__meter`.
* Variables are named to match their corresponding mathematical variables
in the underlying technical references, i.e., `gamma_1`.
* Most values are calculated and stored in `intervalues`
that is passed between function calls.  In general, only the correction factor
functions return their result as a value.

## Configure and Build ##

### C++ Software

The software is designed to be built into a DLL (or corresponding library for non-Windows systems). The source code can be built for any OS that supports the standard C++ libraries. A Visual Studio 2019 project file is provided for Windows users to support the build process and configuration.

### C#/.NET Wrapper Software

The .NET support of eHata consists of a simple pass-through wrapper around the native DLL.  It is compiled to target .NET Framework 4.7.2.  Distribution and updates are provided through the published [NuGet package](https://github.com/NTIA/ehata/packages).
